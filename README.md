Exploratory Data Analysis of TTC Subway Delay Data

When doing data projects, I often focus on topics and datasets that are familiar to me. As a Torontonian, there is nothing more familiar than Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) delays. If you live in Toronto and have taken transit, you've felt the frustration of the TTC delays.

The TTC has releases data monthly about delays on buses, streetcars and subways on the Toronto Open Data Portal. I mostly use the subway, so I decided to focus on subway data. In this project, I'll explore the data to see what are the most common delays? Where and when do they occur? And, has the number been changing over time? In a future project, I'll use what I"ve learned to build a model to predict the length of delays. Because every commuter would love to peek into the cab of the subway car and get some clues about whether they will arrive on time today?



Data files 
- There are three data files downloaded from the Toronto Open Data Portal 
-- "ttc-subway-delay-codes.xlsx"
--"ttc-subway-delay-data-2018.xlsx"
--"ttc-subway-delay-data-2019.xlsx"

There needs to be a folder called "combined" in the "Data" folder, because that is where the combined data set will be exported.  
There is currently a combined dataset in the folder, but it will get overwritten when you run the jupyter notebook. 


How to:
When you run the notebook, the "Data" folder needs to be in the current working directory.
