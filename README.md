# TTCdelay_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis of TTC Subway Delay Data

Data files 
- There are three data files downloaded from the Toronto Open Data Portal 
-- "ttc-subway-delay-codes.xlsx"
--"ttc-subway-delay-data-2018.xlsx"
--"ttc-subway-delay-data-2019.xlsx"

There needs to be a folder called "combined" in the "Data" folder, because that is where the combined data set will be exported.  
There is currently a combined dataset in the folder, but it will get overwritten when you run the jupyter notebook. 


How to:
When you run the notebook, the "Data" folder needs to be in the current working directory.
